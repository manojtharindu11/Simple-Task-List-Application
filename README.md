# Simple Task List Application

This is a simple task list application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

### Event Listeners

- **Click on Task**: Marks the task as complete or incomplete.
- **Click on "Ã—"**: Deletes the task from the list.
- **Double-Click on Task**: Edits the task content via a prompt.
